# 📊 Swaraj Store Data Analysis

This project is a simple yet insightful analysis of Swaraj Store’s sales data.  
I used **Excel** to clean the data, create charts, and build a small dashboard to understand how the store performs — from best-selling products to overall sales trends.

## 🔍 What I Did
- Cleaned and organized raw store data  
- Built pivot tables and charts for quick insights  
- Found patterns in sales and customer behavior  
- Highlighted what’s working well and what needs attention

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (for cleaning, visualization & dashboards)

## 💭 Future Ideas
Planning to automate this analysis using **Python (Pandas + Matplotlib)** and maybe build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** later.
